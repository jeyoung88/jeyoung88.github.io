## How Node application scale
- Node is a hybrid when it comes to concurrency. At the programmer level it is a single threaded model utilizing system event loops and non-blocking IO to handle larger number of requests. When a request comes in, the event is put into the system event queue. Then the request will be put to sleep. Meanwhile the main thread can take other request or process the event waiting to be process. When a particular request's work is done, the sleeping request will be woken up by the main thread. 
- However, Node also use libuv library which has a multi-thread pool. Certain computation Node can decide to use this library to take advantage of the multi-threading capability, but programmers have no control.
- Most database drivers that are written in lower level language can also be multi-threaded.
- Newer version of Node also start to support the Worker threads model.

## Best Practice for Node scalability
Node application is very light way compare to other runtime systems. It is a conventional practice now to package and deploy Node's application in docker. In turns we can deploy a massive number of these docker wrapped application in the Cloud such as using Kubernetes . PDF Generator is even more well suited for this type of deployment because it is stateless. The context of the application is captured in <u>each HTTP request memory space</u>. Thus, it can support thousands or tens of thousands of concurrent call when adequate number of docker images are deployed.
